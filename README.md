## I've divided the project into two apps: the Encyclopedia and the Query.

In **encyclopedia/views.py**, there are only two functions:
1. **index**: to display the created entries.
2. **show_page**: which showcases the content of the entries.

In the **query app**, all the magic happens.  Functions such as **create_page, edit_page, random_page, and search** are listed in **query/views.py**.
If you visit **query/views.py**, you'll find all of them there.
